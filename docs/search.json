The latter offers a free tier account with 25 hours of computing time per months and can be accessed using ones GitHub.com account.\n\nFor the course, participants are required to bring their own laptop to be able to participate in the exercises.\n\nOptional reading list\n\nExcellent and very comprehensive R Packages (2e)\n(Hardcore) description of how Writing R Extensions works\nGitHub ‘Hello World’ tutorial on how to use GitHub.com (does not require git command line knowledge)\nTutorial on version control with git and SVN (we will be using git)\nCommand line git mini intro trygit\nfirst steps with git & github by RStudio\nRStudio cheatsheets/ Git & GitHub"
