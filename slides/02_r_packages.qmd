## What you know already

- Packages provide a mechanism for loading optional code, data and documentation as needed.
- A library is a directory into which packages are installed. 
- `install.packages()` and `R CMD INSTALL` is used to install packages into the library.
- `library()` is used to load packages from the library.
  - This attaches the packages at the same time.
- Remember that package $\neq$ library!
  
## What we want to talk about now

- How to write, build, test, and check your own package `r emoji::emoji("blush")`
- How to do this in a good and sustainable way.
- Give tips and tricks based on practical experience.

## How is a package structured?

Package source = directory with files and subdirectories.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Mandatory:
  - DESCRIPTION
  - NAMESPACE
  - R
  - man
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Typically also:
  - data
  - inst
  - src
  - tests
  - vignettes
  - NEWS
:::
:::

## How to get started quickly

Once upon a time, developers would set up this structure manually. `r emoji::emoji("yawning_face")`

Nowadays, it is super fast with:

- `usethis::create_package()` 
- RStudio > File > New Project > New Directory > R Package

![](resources/rstudio-rpackage.png){.r-stretch}

## DESCRIPTION File

- *Package*: Choose the name of your package. 
  - Not unimportant!
  - Check CRAN whether your name is still available.
- *Title*: Add a Title for Your Package. (Title Case)
- *Version*: Start with a low package version.
  - `Major.Minor.Patch` syntax
- *Authors@R*: Add authors and maintainer.
- *Description*: Like an abstract, including references.

## DESCRIPTION File (cont'd)

- *License*: Important for open sourcing.
  - Consider permissive licenses such as Apache and MIT.
- *Depends*:
  - Which R version users need to have at least.
  - Packages that are loaded upon loading your package.
- *Imports*: Packages which you import functions, methods, classes from.
- *Suggests*: Packages for documentation processing (`roxygen2`), running examples, tests (`testthat`), vignettes.

## R Folder

- Only contains R code files (recommended to use `.R` suffix)
- Assigns R objects, i.e. mostly functions, but could also be constant variables, data sets, etc.
- Should not have any side effects, i.e. avoid `require()`, `options()` etc.
- If certain code needs to be sourced first, use on top of file:
```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#' @include dependency.R
NULL
```
