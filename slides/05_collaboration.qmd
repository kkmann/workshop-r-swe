## Version control systems

* manage different versions of a piece of work
* compare and merge diverged versions effectively

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Kevin v1] --> B[Kevin v2]
  B --> C[Kevin v3]
  B --> D[Daniel v1]
  D --> E[Kevin + Daniel v4]
  C --> E
```

* merging parallel edits is not trivial (try it in MS Word 365)


## The de-facto standard: git


## A local git workflow

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
   commit
   commit
   branch develop
   checkout develop
   commit
   commit
   checkout main
   merge develop
   commit
   commit
```


## Collaboration?


## GitHub.com


## A GitHub.com change cycle {.scrollable}

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant K as Kevin
    participant GH as Github server
    participant D as Daniel
    K->>K: make change locally & commit to <feature>
    K->>GH: push commit
    K->>GH: open pull request <br> & request review
    GH->>GH: run automated checks
    GH->>D: notify of request
    D->>D: review code
    D->>GH: request changes
    GH->>K: notify of change requests
    K->>K: implement changes locally & commit
    K->>GH: push commit to open pull request
    GH->>GH: run automated checks
    K->>GH: re-request review
    GH->>D: notify of request
    D->>D: review code
    D->>GH: approve changes
    GH->>K: forward approval
    K->>GH: merge <feature> into <main>
    D->>GH: pull newest version of <main>
```

## Looks awefully complicated, why?

* Reviewer: wait for all automated checks to pass
  * static code analysis (style, linting)
  * passing all unit tests
  * building documentation
* Safe collaboration with less experienced / untrusted people
* Reduces burden on maintainer, scales collaboration
* Single-source-of-truth: main branch
* Asynchronous work on features
