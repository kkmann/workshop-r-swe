## Version control systems

* manage different versions of a piece of work
* compare and merge diverged versions effectively

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Kevin v1] --> B[Kevin v2]
  B --> C[Kevin v3]
  B --> D[Daniel v1]
  D --> E[Kevin + Daniel v4]
  C --> E
```

* merging parallel edits is not trivial (try it in MS Word 365)


## The de-facto standard: git


## A local git workflow

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
   commit
   commit
   branch develop
   checkout develop
   commit
   commit
   checkout main
   merge develop
   commit
   commit
```


## Collaboration?


## GitHub.com


## {background-iframe="https://r-universe.dev/search/" background-interactive="true"}


## A GitHub.com change cycle {.scrollable}

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant K as Kevin
    participant GH as Github server
    participant D as Daniel
    K->>K: make change locally & commit to <feature>
    K->>GH: push commit
    K->>GH: open pull request
    GH->>GH: run automated checks
    K->>D: request review
    D->>D: review code
    D->>K: request changes
    K->>K: implement changes locally & commit
    K->>GH: push commit
    GH->>GH: run automated checks
    K->>D: request review
    D->>D: review code
    D->>GH: approve changes, unblocking merge
    K->>GH: merge <feature> into <main>
    GH->>GH: run automated checks on <main>
    D->>GH: pull newest version of <main>
```


## Looks awefully complicated, why?

* Safe/efficient collaboration with novice/untrusted people
* Reviewer: rely on automated checks to reduce burden
  * static code analysis (style, linting)
  * passing all unit tests
  * building documentation
* Asynchronous work on features

$\leadsto$ making code-collaboration scalable


## Demo

* Live demonstration of a github cycle
* Dummy template repository at ...
  * Can be 'copied' by anyone
* I will make a change and have it reviewed
* Follow along live on the repository


## Practical

* Work in teams of 3
* Go to [https://github.com/kkmann/simulatr](https://github.com/kkmann/simulatr) and read through the instructions
* One(!) team member clicks on 'Use this template' button and invites the others as collaborators
* ...
