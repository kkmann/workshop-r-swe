# Take away messages

## R package structure

-   R package = folder structure with (many) conventions
-   With modern tools `usethis`, `roxygen2` it is easy to start a new package
-   Packaging a set of functions is an ideal way to share with collaborators and the public
-   Start small and simple and over time you can learn additional options

## Engineering Workflow

-   Use a workable workflow:\
    Idea $\rightarrow$ Design docs $\rightarrow$ Programming $\rightarrow$ Quality check $\rightarrow$ Publication
    -   Don't waste time on maintenance
    -   Be faster with release on CRAN
    -   Fulfill regulatory requirements
-   Refactor your one-off scripts that you want to use in a package
-   Use assertions for all arguments $\rightarrow$ Usability/UX
-   Implement common generics like `print` and `plot`

## Ensuring Quality

-   Apply common clean code rules, e.g.,
    -   Use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) to test, test, and test
    -   Use [covr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=covr) to improve the test coverage
    -   Use [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org) to optimize the code styling
    -   Don't repeat yourself!
-   Your rewards are:
    -   [{{< fa trophy size=1x >}}]{.yellow} **Maintainability**,
    -   [{{< fa trophy size=1x >}}]{.yellow} **Extensibility**, and
    -   [{{< fa trophy size=1x >}}]{.yellow} **Performance**!

## Collaboration

- **Version control is key**
    - Multiple people working on code without strong VC $\leadsto$ disaster!
    - There are different options, but git is the defacto standard for R packages
    - Git needs a friend - use platforms like GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
- **Automated CI/CD allows for much quicker iteration**
    - Automate tests to avoid bugs slipping back in
- **Technology does not solve everything - foster a positive culture**
    - Keep internal and external contributors engaged
    - Invest in documentation to make it easier to contribute
    
## Publication

-   `pkgdown` can help you easily create a nice website for your package
-   Versions and licenses along with `NEWS` updates are important
-   GitHub helps with tagging of release versions
-   R-Hub helps with checking before CRAN submission

# Closing remarks

## Thank you!

::: {.column width="70%"}
-   It was great to teach you today on how to build R packages
-   Let's keep in touch e.g. via [gitter chat channel](https://gitter.im/workshop-r-swe/community) for this course that you can connect to
-   We might do another course in Basel in the future if we get enough interest
-   We welcome feedback on topics/format/content - reach out!

## Possible next steps

-   Bring the information back to your colleagues in your organization
-   Start building your first own package and share internally first
-   Later publish it open source on GitHub and submit it to CRAN
-   Learn about more tips and tricks how to extend R
