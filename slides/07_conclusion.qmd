# Take away messages

## R package structure

- R package = folder structure with (many) conventions
- With modern tools `usethis`, `roxygen2` it is easy to start a new package
- Packaging a set of functions is an ideal way to share with collaborators and the public
- Start small and simple and over time you can learn additional options

## Workflow

## Quality

## Collaboration

## Publication

- `pkgdown` can help you easily create a nice website for your package
- Versions and licenses along with `NEWS` updates are important
- GitHub helps with tagging of release versions
- R-Hub helps with checking before CRAN submission

## Possible next steps

- Bring the information back to your colleagues in your organization
- Start building your first own package and share internally first
- Later publish it open source on GitHub and submit it to CRAN
- Learn about more tips and tricks how to extend R
